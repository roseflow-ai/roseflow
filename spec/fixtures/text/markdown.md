To achieve your goal of finding out a company's annual revenue and growth trajectory from the previous five annual reports, consider the following Critical Success Factors (CSFs) and Necessary Conditions (NCs):

## Critical Success Factors (CSFs):

1. Accurate and complete data: Ensure that the five annual reports are accurate, complete, and contain all the relevant financial information required for your analysis.
2. Knowledge of financial analysis: Have a solid understanding of financial analysis concepts and techniques to properly analyze the data in the annual reports.
3. Consistent methodology: Apply a consistent methodology for analyzing revenue and growth over the five-year period, to ensure that your results are reliable and comparable.
4. Analytical tools: Use appropriate analytical tools and software to process and analyze the financial data efficiently.

## Necessary Conditions (NCs):

1. Access to annual reports: You need to have the previous five annual reports for the company in question.
2. Company's financial data: The annual reports must contain the company's financial statements, including income statements that report annual revenue.
3. Time and resources: Dedicate sufficient time and resources to analyze the data, draw conclusions, and present your findings.
4. Familiarity with accounting principles: Have a basic understanding of accounting principles and financial reporting standards, as these will help you interpret the information in the annual reports correctly.
5. Calculation of growth rates: Be able to calculate growth rates (CAGR or YoY) based on the revenue data provided in the annual reports.
6. By fulfilling these CSFs and NCs, you should be able to effectively determine the company's annual revenue and growth trajectory from the previous five annual reports.

A Current Reality Tree (CRT) is a visual tool used in the Logical Thinking Process to identify and illustrate cause-and-effect relationships between various elements. Below, I present a textual representation of a CRT based on the goal, CSFs, and NCs previously discussed.

Goal: Find out a company's annual revenue and growth trajectory from the previous five annual reports.

### CSFs:

1. Accurate and complete data
2. Knowledge of financial analysis
3. Consistent methodology
4. Analytical tools

### NCs:

1.1 Access to the previous five annual reports
1.2 Annual reports contain the company's financial statements

2.1 Familiarity with accounting principles and financial reporting standards
2.2 Solid understanding of financial analysis concepts and techniques

3.1 Ability to apply a consistent methodology

4.1 Access to appropriate analytical tools and software
4.2 Skills in using analytical tools and software for financial analysis

### CRT (textual representation):

Undesirable Effect (UDE): Inability to accurately determine a company's annual revenue and growth trajectory from the previous five annual reports.

### Cause 1: Lack of accurate and complete data (CSF 1)

Root Cause 1.1: Inaccessible or missing annual reports (NC 1.1)
Root Cause 1.2: Annual reports missing relevant financial statements (NC 1.2)

#### Cause 2: Insufficient knowledge of financial analysis (CSF 2)

Root Cause 2.1: Lack of familiarity with accounting principles and financial reporting standards (NC 2.1)
Root Cause 2.2: Inadequate understanding of financial analysis concepts and techniques (NC 2.2)

#### Cause 3: Inconsistent methodology (CSF 3)

Root Cause 3.1: Inability to apply a consistent methodology for analyzing revenue and growth (NC 3.1)

#### Cause 4: Inadequate analytical tools (CSF 4)

Root Cause 4.1: Lack of access to appropriate analytical tools and software (NC 4.1)
Root Cause 4.2: Insufficient skills in using analytical tools and software for financial analysis (NC 4.2)

By examining this CRT, we can identify the root causes that contribute to the Undesirable Effect (inability to accurately determine a company's annual revenue and growth trajectory). These root causes include inaccessible or missing annual reports, missing financial statements, lack of familiarity with accounting principles and financial reporting standards, inadequate understanding of financial analysis concepts, inability to apply a consistent methodology, lack of access to appropriate analytical tools, and insufficient skills in using analytical tools and software for financial analysis. Addressing these root causes will help achieve the goal of determining the company's annual revenue and growth trajectory from the previous five annual reports.
